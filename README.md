# My-Website

Currently in the process of creating a personal site to portray all relevant projects and eventually a blog page.
Projects to be included are Mechanical Design projects, Computational projects and Volunteering efforts.
Blog page to eventually have review articles on various interests in life ranging from finance to my walk with the Lord Jesus.

Implementing HTML, CSS and Javascript.
